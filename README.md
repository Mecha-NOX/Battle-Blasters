# **Battle Blasters**

*A Multiplayer Shooter Adventure | Developed in Unreal Engine 5*

---

## **Overview**

**Battle Blasters** is a fast-paced multiplayer shooter where players control cartoon-style characters in an intense deathmatch or capture-the-flag mode. The game features an array of powerful weapons such as sniper rifles, rocket launchers, and grenades, which can be picked up during matches. This project showcases my skills in Unreal Engine 5 development, focusing on multiplayer systems, weapon mechanics, and network optimization.
